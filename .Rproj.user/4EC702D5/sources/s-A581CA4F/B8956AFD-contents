## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



## test to load my own tool

**DComboNet** tryout *time* 1

```{r message=FALSE}
library(DT)
library(DComboNet)
load_dir = "G:/lab/DCcomboNet/Rpackage/input_data/"
druglist = read.table(paste0(load_dir,"/data/drugtarget.csv"), sep = ",", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(druglist)
datatable(druglist, options = list(pageLength = 5))
#test = SE.sim(druglist = druglist, load_dir = load_dir)

#knitr::kable(test[1:5,1:5])

```
